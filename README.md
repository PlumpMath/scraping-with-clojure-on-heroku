# Scraping the Web with Clojure and Enlive and Deploying Clojure Applications on Heroku #

slides from my presentation at the Feb/2012 Tulsa Web Devs meeting.

## Requirements ##

These slides were created with [showoff](http://rubygems.org/gems/showoff).

    $ gem install showoff
    $ git clone (showoff-repo)
    $ cd (showoff-repo)
    $ showoff serve

By default, showoff boots up a WEBrick server running on port 9090. Once the server's up, fire up a browser and hit localhost:9090.
